title: "Typographic Firsts a book by John Boardley"
description: "How were the first fonts made? Who invented italics? When did we figure out how to print in color?  Many of the standard features of printed books were designed by pioneering typographers and printers in the latter half of the fifteenth century. Johannes Gutenberg is credited with printing the first books in Europe with moveable type in the fifteenth century, but many different European printers and publishers went on to find innovative solutions to replicate the appearance of manuscript books in print and improve on them throughout the Renaissance. The illustrated examples in Typographic Firsts originate in those early decades, bringing into focus the influences and innovations that shaped the printed book and established a Western typographic canon.  From the practical challenges of polychromatic printing and sheet music printing to the techniques for illustrating books with woodcuts and producing books for children to the design of the first fonts, these stories chart the invention of the printed book, the world's first means of mass communication. Also covering title pages, maps, printing in gold, and printing in color, this book shows how a mixture of happenstance and brilliant technological innovation came together to form the typographic and design conventions of the book."

title: "Can Creativity be Taught and/or Learned? A Sketch from Higher Education Learning Outcomes"
description: "Creativity embodies the ability to discover new and innovative ideas, links, and problems’ solutions. Creativity is a competitive advantage that enables both individuals and organizations to succeed in increasingly demanding markets. Therefore, the development of this competence has become central to the debate on curricula within education systems and the labor market. So, the present study seeks to address how creativity has been defined in the scope of learning outcomes of the new study programs under quality evaluation and subsequent accreditation in the Portuguese higher education system. Adopting a qualitative approach, a content analysis of these learning outcomes was carried out using a theoretical and empirically validated conceptual matrix. Results point out for universities and the public sector of Portuguese higher education system tend to value more creativity as a desirable learning outcome, as well as some scientific fields, such as Engineering, Information and Media, Humanities, Life Sciences, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Arts and Architecture. Conversely, Law, Education, Social Sciences and Business Sciences are explicit examples of the undervaluation of competences related to creativity as part of the professional profile of their graduates. Findings help to understand the real importance that Portuguese higher education institutions attribute to creativity in their academic curricula."

description: "Phaidon's forthcoming 1000 Design Classics really should be called 1000 Industrial Design Classics, as nearly everything in it was mass-produced, but I'll be grateful the book exists rather than quibble over the title. The single tome draws from the three-volume Phaidon Design Classics, but costs less and adds more:"

# Contemporary Design Education in Australia


```cardlink
url: https://intellectdiscover.com/content/books/9781789388671
title: "Contemporary Design Education in Australia | Intellect"
description: "This book offers a range of approaches to teaching higher education design students to learn to design collaboratively and creatively, through transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning experiences.It highlights that the premise of traditional disciplinary silos does little to advance the competencies needed for contemporary design and non-linear career paths. It makes the point that higher education should respond to the impacts of a changing society, including fluctuating market demands, economic variations, uncertainties, and globalization.Chapters highlight approaches that address this changing landscape, to meet student, industry and societal needs and reflect a range of design education contexts in which the authors have taught, with a focus on experiences at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia, but also including collaborations and comparative discussions elsewhere in Australia and globally, spanning Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and the United States.The book is positioned not as a definitive theoretical model for transdisciplinary design education but instead as a collective of chapters in which many forms of learning are explored through overarching themes of curriculum design and experiential and authentic learning and collaboration, transforming professional identities, and design cultures."
