                    <p>

                        I hope you're doing well. It was nice to see you on during block 1. I'd like to meet you again in <mark>block 2 or a date that works for you</mark> and have a chat.</p>

                    <p>Before our meeting, can you complete the one of the following activities?</p>

                    <p>One activity is to go to our <a href="https://mmu.careercentre.me/Resources/CustomPage/14497">Career Pulse</a> website. There are 14 questions about self-awareness, employability skills, career possibilities and work experience. It's
                        a lot, but you don't have to do all 14. Please focus on <mark>area(s) that you consider most suitable for your tutee</mark>, and we'll have a chat about it.</p>

                    <p>Or another activity that you can do before we meet, is to explore the various <a href="https://mmu.careercentre.me/Resources/CareerPathways/">carreer pathways</a> that you can take. We can then discuss it further when we meet.</p>

                    <p>I look forward to meeting you again!</p>
                    <p><mark>(Your name)</mark></p>
